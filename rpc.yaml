    # if scrape model has an array with object inside 
    # with multiple Nodes as values, i have to scrape thes nodes concurrently:
    # scraped one node i check the other type, checking if it is the right edge,
    # if it is then i pack it in the object and continue with the next.
    # another option would be:
    # scrape: { links: [Link], names: [Name] }
    # but this way i would loose the relation that names have with links
    
    
    # scrape is done adding to the state of the reducer the scraped data
    # at the last cycle the reducer returns the state and 
    # doing so returns all the accumulated (and merged!) data
    
    # data is merged so if you go to differend pages with the same type of data you
    # can scrape a clean object with all similar data in same keys,
    # without having to insert keys like { page1: {...}, page2: {...} }
